If you were to look at the [DuckDuckHack Open Source Community] and glance at all the home-made Instant Answers that show up alongside our 3 billion yearly searches - you might take our community for granted. 

We certainly don’t. Getting to this level of activity, scale, and leadership has taught us several powerful lessons about what makes an open source community thrive - *particularly one symbiotic with a startup.*

## Go With the Flow

DuckDuckGo has had a community since day one; we just didn’t know it.
From the early days (and even before), Gabe had been asking for feedback and involving the various groups he was a part of. As people took note of the search engine, they had ideas for how they could help and an unofficial API was born. 

The first Instant Answers were more easter eggs than anything. Soon enough, people began using the search engine to make useful sources of data more accessible. Over time, despite an ambiguous API or way to contribute, our search results gradually became better thanks to these contributions.

Our lesson was to see what people tend to want to do already. Before you map out a grand open-source vision, pause - and observe. Where are people naturally offering to contribute? Are people excited about adding their own code/plugins/integrations to what you’re working on? 

**Lesson #1: Encourage contributions being made naturally.**

## Be Valuable to Your Community

As you observe people contributing, consider ***why*** they’re doing so. There’s usually a few reasons.

People might contribute in order to:

- Create a feature they personally want
- Gain visibility for another project they’re working on
- Build professional experience and credentials
- Work with smart people all over the world

Instead of thinking about how an open-source initiative helps your organization, think about it the other way around: *How can your platform potentially help and support other people and projects?*

**Lesson #2: Observe *why* people contribute, and think of how you can be even more valuable to them.**

## Open Source Should Help Your Company, Too

In the early days of DuckDuckGo, we were just three people managing a search engine with, at the time, a million queries a day. As contributions picked up, we found it hard to keep up with pull requests, issues, and quality documentation. 

Then came a critical realization: our mission was, and is, to compete with billion-dollar search giants. However, we wanted to do that without becoming them or emulating their practices. We also realized that the best, most unique, most delightful Instant Answers and translations would not come from inside the company.

**The key was community.** We gave the community more of our time, and saw contributions shoot up in return.

Open source communities don’t raise themselves; they require ownership, leadership, and active curation. At first, that comes from you. 

**Lesson #3: Make sure the success of the open source project aligns with your company’s goals.**

## Create a Home for Your Community

What is an online community if not the sum of its collaboration channels? 

Early on, collaboration was spread all over the place. We had a Uservoice ideas board, a Zoho forum, a separate docs site, GitHub for code… you get the point. We quickly moved to simplify the community’s presence as much as possible - and create clear paths to each task.

Think from the point of view of someone new to your project. There should be one single starting point for them to visit and decide how to contribute. It should also be clear what the next steps are - and how to achieve them.

**Lesson #4: Centralize your presence and make navigation easy.**

## Make It Easy to Start

It may sound ridiculous, but our original development environment took 2 hours to set up. It required local installation of a custom tool - plus all its dependencies. 

We then switched to a cloud-IDE with a ready-to-go environment; it now takes 5 minutes or less. The result? More than twice the number of unique contributors every month since.

**The most intimidating part about contributing to open source is getting up to speed.** Do everything you can to lower barriers to entry.

Documentation - while less sexy - is a huge opportunity to fuel contributions. When we invested in “quick start” step-by-step tutorials, we saw a huge increase in new contributors.

**Lesson #5: Make it as easy as possible for someone new to get to their first commit.**

## Make It Easy to Win

The best source of open source contributors is **people who are *new* to open source**. Many developers are looking for that first opportunity to get involved - one where they feel they can make an impact.

One of the best investments we made in our open source project was making it easy to add a personal “hello world” easter egg to our live search engine. We received tons of these pull requests! Turns out that *seeing code run live after just an hour is an incredible motivator.* 

**Lesson #6: Do everything you can to welcome and include new contributions.**

## Keep People Around
You’ve made it easy to find, easy to get started, and easy to win - the final step is to help contributors stay involved.

We learned that communities don’t run themselves: Active leadership is a pre-requisite. People stay engaged when they feel others are also engaged. Make sure pull requests don’t sit stagnant, that issues get discussed, and that idea forums stay fresh.

Even if a contribution can’t be incorporated, try to capture as much value from every contribution. Perhaps redirect the effort, or find a way to connect them with another contributor. 

No matter what, make sure to positively - and genuinely - reinforce the effort someone made. The goal is to keep contributors involved long term - and that’s what makes for a great community.

**Lesson #7: Every interaction with the community should make people want to stick around.**

----

Our first open-source commit took place almost exactly four years ago. Our community has since contributed hundreds of data sources and thousands of pull requests. **These amount to 450+ Instant Answers which appear on 3 billion searches a year.** 

We certainly have a long way to go, but we’ve learned that a great open source community **comes down to understanding people.** 

In short:

1. Encourage contributions that are already happening naturally.
2. Observe *why* people contribute, and think of how you can be even more valuable to them.
3. Make sure the success of the open source project aligns with your company’s goals.
4. Centralize your presence and make navigation easy.
5. Make it as easy as possible for someone new to get to their first commit.
6. Do everything you can to welcome and include new contributions.
7. Every interaction with the community should make people want to stick around.

By carving out a breadth of contribution options - DuckDuckHack became a place where nearly everyone could contribute to - and benefit from - the community.
